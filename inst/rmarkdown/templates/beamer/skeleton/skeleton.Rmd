# Section 1

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown presentation. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.


## Slide with Bullets

- Bullet 1
- Bullet 2
- Bullet 3

If you want to have more control over the style (e.g. vertical space between items) you can use
raw latex code:

\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{1em}
\item one
\item two
\item three
\end{itemize}


## Slide with R Output

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
do_something = function(x, y) {
  x + y
}

summary(cars)
```


# Section 2

## Slide with Plot

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```


## Some Math

$$
f(x) = x + x^2 + (x - \mu)^2 + \mathbf{x}
$$

With a tcolorbox:

\begin{tcolorbox}
Here you can put some content.
$f(x) = x^2$
\end{tcolorbox}
